Task 1: Display ảnh, video với font chữ (Thien)
Task 2: research timer interrupt (HoangDo)
Topic: Scaffold & Hammer: A platforming game with a character destroying falling projectile or the projectile will blow up the ground underneath the player and lose the game. The high score record with each projectile destroyed and power up taken. Throw button can be held to throw stronger and a thrown hammer to destroy the projectile will inherit the momentum of the object (pseudo per say, move right throw right will be thrown up right while move right will be just right). Hammer will bounce if thrown strong enough.
